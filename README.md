# Image-Classification-Algorithms-using-CIFAR-10-Dataset


These are three algorithms or attempts at them, if anyone wants to use a ready made classifier they can look at these.

## 1st is the Classifier using Euclidean or Manhatten distance (I have commented out one of them you can see both implemented in it.) , Its a simple algorithm that measures the straight line distance of the test image with all the images in the training set. It assigns the class of the nearest training image to the test image.

## 2nd is the Baysian Probability Classifier, it checks the RGB channels of each image and measures the probability of the test image belonging to each class. The test image is assgined the class with which it has highest probability.

## 3rd is an attempt to build a neural network, I have used both ANNs and CNNs, tweaked different parameters and tested the accuracies. Feel free to adjust to your linking.

There is also a accuracy check function as well.
